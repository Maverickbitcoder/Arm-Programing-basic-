# 🔧 ARM Assembly Language Programs – Educational Project for Beginners

Welcome to a carefully curated collection of **ARM Assembly Language Programs**, built specifically for **beginners, students, and educators**. This repository contains 10 well-commented `.s` files, each demonstrating fundamental programming concepts using the **ARM32 architecture**.

These examples are ideal for:

- 👨‍🎓 College/university students working on system programming or computer architecture assignments  
- 💡 Self-learners exploring ARM assembly from scratch  
- 🧠 Beginners aiming to understand low-level computation

## 📘 What Is ARM Assembly?

Assembly language is a **low-level programming language** that communicates directly with a computer's hardware. ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) is a popular CPU architecture used in most smartphones, embedded systems, and even Raspberry Pi.

ARM Assembly programming helps you understand:

- CPU registers and memory
- Arithmetic/logic operations
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- How high-level logic maps to machine instructions

## 📂 What's in This Repo?

This project includes **11 ARM assembly source files**. Each program is focused on a specific concept to keep learning modular and clear.

| Filename     | Description | Concepts Covered |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|
| `Code 1.s`   | Adds two numbers | Data movement, addition |
| `Code 2.s`   | Subtracts one number from another | Subtraction, register usage |
| `Code 3.s`   | Multiplies two numbers | Loop-based multiplication |
| `Code 4.s`   | Divides two numbers | Division logic, loops |
| `Code 5.s`   | Checks if a number is even or odd | Bitwise operations, branching |
| `Code 6.s`   | Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers | Looping, counters |
| `Code 7.s`   | Computes factorial of a number | Multiplicative loops |
| `Code 8.s`   | Reverses the digits of a number | Modulo, division, register usage |
| `Code 9.s`   | Checks if a number is a palindrome | Logic flow, number reversal |
| `Code 10.s`  | Generates the Fibonacci sequence | Conditionals, loops, iterative logic |
| `Code 11.s`  | **[placeholder until analyzed]** | **[TBD]** |
